# Fourier-Series-Computation
Python Code Performing Fourier Series Calculation

## Python
Python was used to complete the Fourier Series calculations provided in the code.

## Objective of the Code
The code provided served the role of determining the Fourier series of different signals provided in a practical document for a university project. In the end, this project was majorly an introductory programming project providing insight into using python as a mathematical tool and plotting determined waveforms. 

As personal development, this project exposed me to the Jupyter Notebook IDE. From this point, I mainly used Jupyter Notebook for majority of my university career for integrated conversion from a .ipynb to .pdf file types. However, I moved over to vscode in my final year of study with minor Jupyter Notebook work occasionally.

## Future Work That Could've Been Added
Introducing interactive waveforms into the outputs would have greatly improved the userability of the code with data-point tracking as well.

## Accreditation
This project was a group project whereby the code generated was consolidated with Ian De Villiers and Nicole Wreyford
